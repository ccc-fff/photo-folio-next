## Entrailles

For a long time, I saw cars as nothing but trivial objects, visual pollution resulting from their omnipresence. It was a car at the end of its life that led me to a scrapyard where, paradoxically, these carcasses revealed their unexpected beauty. In these stigmata and scars, I discovered the character forged by their histories. In our streets, our parking lots, our peripheries.

These metal skins, both refuges and witnesses, tell our lives in fragments. Forgotten objects, improvised modifications, traces of wear become so many clues to our existences. Each interior transformed by its occupants or altered by time becomes the matrix of our own metamorphoses.

One could smile at these haphazard arrangements, these clumsy attempts at personalization. Yet these interiors reflect the precariousness of our existences filled with compensatory objects. They testify to our erratic journeys, our illusory need for control, while the accident always lurks, ready to collapse like a house of cards our most meticulous plans.

Entrailles reveals, through these banal details buried under the weight of their overabundance, our aspirations, flaws, and habits.

## Dans la rue

"Hello! I photograph strangers on the street, would you agree to pose? I'll send you the images afterward."

This is more or less how I approach passersby. Refusals are frequent, though sometimes amusing. Some don't let me finish my sentence, as if I were begging for alms. This vulnerability is inherent to the process; each outing requires me to push myself to approach others, to ask for a bit of their time and trust.

I set up my device in a busy location: a simple white backdrop about two meters square, a medium format camera on a tripod. I observe the flow of pedestrians with their varied appearances and watch for an opening. During the few minutes of the session, instructions are minimal; don't hide behind a smile, just be there. Yet everyone comes with their own projections, gives what they can. I adapt, it's their moment too.

I indicate when I feel we've reached the end, collect their contact information, and we say goodbye. Later, they'll discover the result in a folder bearing their name. Responses vary, people are generally grateful, sometimes polite, other times they don't like what they see. Yet the essential has already taken place face to face.

It is at the heart of this encounter without geography that these strangers emerge, suddenly remarkable by the simple fact of having considered each other.

## Fiat lux

God said: Let there be light! And there was light.

Since that first day when darkness was separated from brightness, humanity has never stopped pushing back the frontiers of the night.

In this series, matter fades away to leave only the very essence of light—bright points, diffuse halos, fleeting flashes. These black and white photographs capture that moment when the eye, confronted with darkness, seeks to cling to the slightest glimmers.

Like urban constellations, these nocturnal scenes reveal themselves slowly, inviting the gaze to lose itself in their luminous abstraction before piercing their mystery.

## U sudu

This South is not a cardinal point; it is an invitation to lands where our polished humanity rediscovers the raw power of life.

Human structures never far from dissolving to rejoin and nourish the vegetal fertility. This erosion reveals our animality that we try to contain, and this south offers the possibility of a reconciliation with this form of primordial and essential freedom.

## Phusis

At night, under the flash, plants emerge. Torn from the indistinction of the landscape, they appear as they truly are: forms that think. Each stem is a gesture, each leaf a decision made in the slow time of growth.

*Phusis*, in ancient Greek, designates less nature than emergence—that which springs forth of itself toward the light. Here, it is the light that comes to them, and in that instant, their architecture is unveiled as lightning reveals the shape of air.

These plant portraits do not document species. They question what each plant knows of the world—and what it tells us about it.
